# Cross-Platform Development Guide

Although WinHome is an "Infrastructure-as-Code tool for Windows," it is built using **modern .NET
10**, allowing developers on **Linux** and **macOS** to contribute to the project effectively.

## 💻 Developing on Linux & macOS

### 1. Prerequisites

- **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)**: Required for building and
  running unit tests.
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: With the **C# Dev Kit** extension.

### 2. Building the Project

You can compile the solution normally on any platform:

```bash
dotnet build WinHome.sln
```

### 3. Running Unit Tests

Our unit tests are designed with **abstractions and mocks**. This means you can run the logic-heavy
unit tests (like config parsing, state management logic, and plugin discovery) without being on
Windows:

```bash
dotnet test tests/WinHome.Tests/WinHome.Tests.csproj
```

## ⚠️ Platform Limitations

WinHome is a **Windows-native engine**. While the code compiles on other OSs, the core
reconciliation logic (`Engine.cs`) contains platform guards:

- **Registry/Services/WSL**: These modules will be skipped or throw errors if run natively on
  Linux/macOS.
- **Dry-Run**: You can run `dotnet run -- --dry-run` to test configuration parsing and plugin
  loading, but many modules will log "Skipping: Platform not supported."

## 🧪 Testing Windows Logic from Linux/macOS

If you are modifying Windows-specific logic (e.g., the Registry Service) and need to verify it:

### 1. Automated CI (Recommended)

Push your branch to your fork. Our **GitHub Actions CI** (`test.yaml`) runs on `windows-latest` VMs.
It will execute the full suite, including E2E tests, on a real Windows environment.

### 2. Remote Development

Use the **VS Code Remote - SSH** extension to connect to a Windows machine or VM and develop/debug
directly in that environment.

### 3. Windows Containers / VM

If you have a local Windows machine, you can use the scripts in `test-data/` to run acceptance tests
inside a clean Windows Sandbox.
